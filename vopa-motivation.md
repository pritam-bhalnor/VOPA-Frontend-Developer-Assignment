# Motivation for Frontend Developer Role at VOPA

I'm excited about the Frontend Developer role at VOPA because it combines my passion for clean, interactive UI with a meaningful mission—bringing transparency to public procurement.

I enjoy turning complex data into engaging visual stories using React, TypeScript, and tools like AG Grid. My focus on clear typography, intuitive layouts, and thoughtful interactions like filtering, sorting, and tooltips aligns well with your goals.

I value clean code, scalable design, and user-first thinking—making VOPA a perfect fit for my skills and interests.
