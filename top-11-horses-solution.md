# üêé Logic Puzzle Solution: Find the Top 11 Fastest Horses Among 144

This solution outlines the step-by-step strategy to determine the **top 11 fastest horses** out of 144, under the constraint that only 12 horses can race at a time, and **no stopwatch** is allowed ‚Äî only race order is known.

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Constraints

- 144 horses total.
- Only 12 horses can race at once.
- You can only see the **relative finishing order**, not exact times.
- Objective: Find the **top 11 fastest horses** using the **minimum number of races**.

---

## üß† Steps to Solve

### 1. Group Division and Initial Races (12 Races)

Divide the 144 horses into **12 groups** (A to L), with **12 horses in each group**.

‚û°Ô∏è Conduct **12 separate races**, one for each group, to determine the relative order within each group.

---

### 2. Determine the Fastest Horse (13th Race)

Conduct a **13th race** with the **winners of each group** ‚Äî i.e., A1, B1, ..., L1 (12 horses total).

‚û°Ô∏è This race identifies the **fastest horse overall** and helps determine the strongest groups.  
‚û°Ô∏è You can now **eliminate many horses** that mathematically cannot make it into the top 11.

---

### 3. Final Selection Race (14th Race)

Select **12 horses** that are still in contention based on earlier results. These may include:

- 2nd and 3rd place from the group of the 13th race winner.
- 2nd and 3rd place from groups whose winners finished 2nd and 3rd in the 13th race.
- Other close contenders.

‚û°Ô∏è Run the **14th race** with these 12 horses.  
‚û°Ô∏è Pick the **top 10 finishers** from this race.

---

## üèÅ Final Result

- The **winner of the 13th race** is the **fastest horse (Rank 1)**.
- The **top 10 horses from the 14th race** fill positions **2 to 11**.

‚úÖ **Total Races Required: 14**
